# I'm Lazy

## Discipline is nice, but...

Truthfully, I've enjoyed writing redirects recently. However, anytime I see a repetitive process (i.e., look at the
`404` report, find the broken link, find the new link, write the redirect, test the redirect, commit the redirect, push
the redirect, and deploy the redirect), I want to automate it. Plus, I wanted to play with Rust ðŸ¦€.

## What does this do?

This is a simple Rust application that will take a series of arguments, separated by spaces, and use Algolia â€” with our
public index, API key, and Application ID â€” to find the first result. It will then format a redirect for you to add to
our `redirects.conf` file in the `hasura/hasura.io` repository.

## How does it work?

First, you'll need to install Rust. Then, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robertjdominguez/ez-redirects.git
```

The `default` branch is `feat/fetch-algolia`.

Once it's cloned, you can run the following command to build the binary:

```bash
cargo build
```

Then, you can run the following command to run the binary:

```bash
cargo run  <arguments>
```

Each `<argument>` is a relative path from the docs site. Running the program will look like this:

```bash
cargo run /docs/latest/nested/upserts /docs/latest/enterprise/prometheus /docs/latest/queries/arguments

## What's next?

- [x] Copy the bulk set of redirects and comment to the clipboard
- [ ] Or, go big and have it `cd` into the `hasura/hasura.io` repo, add the redirects, commit, push to **`stage`**.
